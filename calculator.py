# the dictionary functions.



# TODO Create a print statement that prints the first number, the operator, the second
# number, and what their result is.



# TODO Type 'y' to continue calculating with 'the result', or type 'n' to start a new calculation.
# This means if they enter 'y' that they will be using the previous result as the first 
# number and be prompted to pick an operation again. If they type 'n', a while loop will 
# loop back to the beginning and start from scratch (The program will always be functioning)

# Some code I pre-wrote below that needs to find its place.
